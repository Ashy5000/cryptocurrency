# Layer 2 rollups

Transactions on the blockchain may optionally use a Layer 2 (L2) rollup system to increase throughput and lower transaction fees. By packing multiple transactions into a single one, transaction verification can be offloaded from the main blockchain. The L2 rollup software introduces L2 nodes which collect and aggregate transactions to be included in the body of a single one. A new token is used with a 1:1 ratio to the L1 token and which is secured via smart contracts, written in blockchain assembly.
